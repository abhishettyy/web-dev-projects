# Web-Based Calculator

A responsive and user-friendly calculator built with  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project features a clean, 
retro-inspired design with a digital display font and handles both mouse and keyboard inputs.

## Features

* **Standard Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus , only for two operands at a time.
* **Dual Input Methods**: Fully functional with both mouse clicks and keyboard input for ease of use.
* **Responsive Design**: The layout automatically adjusts for a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
* **Input Management**: Includes "Clear" (Clr) and "Delete" (Del) functionality to easily correct inputs.
* **Retro UI**: A custom digital font and a clean layout provide a visually appealing, classic calculator feel.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5**: For the fundamental structure and layout of the calculator.
* **CSS3**: For all styling, including Flexbox for layout and media queries for responsiveness.
* **JavaScript (ES6)**: For all client-side logic, event handling, and calculations.

## What did I learn?

The core challenge of this project was to build the calculation logic from scratch without relying on built-in functions like `eval()` or AI-assisted code generation. While the resulting logic may not be the most optimal, this approach provided a significant learning experience.

* **Independent Problem-Solving**: The entire calculation engine, including the parsing of numbers and operators, was implemented manually. This was a valuable exercise in algorithmic thinking.
* **Edge Case Handling**: A major takeaway was learning how to identify and handle numerous edge cases, such as trailing operators, negative numbers, and repeated inputs.
* **Debugging with Breakpoints**: The browser's developer tools, particularly using **breakpoints**, were crucial for tracing the flow of data through the code. This was instrumental in understanding the state of the `storage` array and debugging the logic step-by-step.

This project was a practical lesson in the importance of robust debugging and the complexities of state management in an application.
