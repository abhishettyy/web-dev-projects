# 🎵 Spotify-Clone

A clean and modern **Spotify-inspired web interface** built from scratch using **pure HTML and CSS** — with no frameworks, no JavaScript, and no references. This project was a personal challenge to recreate a functional, responsive layout entirely on my own.

##  Features:

-  **Navbar** with Spotify-style branding
-  **Recently Played** music section
-  **Spotify Originals & Podcasts** area
-  **User-created Playlists**
-  Smooth **hover effects** on all cards

##  Technology used:

| CSS3     | Styling and responsive design |
| Flexbox  | Layout system for aligning content |
| Relative Units | Used `em`, `rem`, `%` for scalability |



## 📱 Responsiveness

This project is **partially responsive**.  
It uses relative units and Flexbox to adapt to different screen sizes. Full mobile responsiveness will be added as the next improvement phase.

-  The importance of **planning layout flow** before styling
- How **relative units** improve adaptability across devices
- How to structure reusable sections like cards and playlists



## Upcoming Enhancements:
